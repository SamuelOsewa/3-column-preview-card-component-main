## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I finally started to understand the css box model to an extent and also how to use flexbox to an extent.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.cards {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-top: 150px;
}
```

### Continued development

I definitely continue to work on understanding the box model and how to create beeter and more responsive layout
